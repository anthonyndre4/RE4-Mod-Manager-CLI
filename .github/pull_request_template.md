Thank you for raising a pull request for the RE4-Mod-Manager-CLI, it will be reviewed shorty :smiley:.

## CI/CD

The CI/CD which is currently configured will run the following checks:

    - Unit-Tests
    - Linting

Once this has been done it will trigger the workflow for the main branch which will tag and release.
